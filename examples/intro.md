# Examples

The repository includes example notebooks under `a11y-checker/test_notebooks/`.

- `image-basic-tests.ipynb`
- `heading-basic-tests-1.ipynb`
- `heading-basic-tests-2.ipynb`
- `table-basic-tests.ipynb`

Open any of these in JupyterLab and run the checker to see detections and try the fix interfaces, to get a better understanding of the extension.
